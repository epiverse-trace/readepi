**{readepi}** is an R package for reading data from several health
information systems (HIS) including public repositories, relational
database management systems (RDBMS).

**{readepi}** currently supports reading data from the followings:

- RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) such as MS SQL, MySQL,
  and PostgreSQL 
- [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/software/): Research Electronic
  Data Capture - a secure web application for building and managing
  online surveys and databases  
- [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/about/): an open source and web-based
  platform for managing health information  
- [Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/): a repository of public
  health indicators in England

**{readepi}** returns a list object containing one or more data frames.
**{readepi}** also has a number of auxiliary functions that allow
importing a subset of the original dataset.

**{readepi}** is developed by
[Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) team at the
[Medical Research Center, The Gambia unit at London School of Hygiene
and Tropical
Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia).

## Installation

You can install the development version of **{readepi}** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("epiverse-trace/readepi", build_vignettes = TRUE)
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/readepi")
library(readepi)
```

## Quick start

The main function in **{readepi}** is `readepi()`. It reads data from a
specified source. The `readepi()` function accepts a user-supplied
string (the API’s URL) as argument. Other specific arguments can be
provided depending on the data source (see the **vignette** for more
details). The examples below show how to use the `readepi()` function to
import data from a variety of sources.

### Reading data from RDBMS and HIS

The `readepi()` function can import data from a variety of RDBMS,
including MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Reading data from a RDBMS
requires the following:

1.  A MS SQL driver that is compatible with the version of DBMS of
    interest. The **vignette** describes how to install the appropriate
    driver for each database management system.  
2.  Valid Credentials to access the server. The user credential details
    are expected to be stored in a file that will be supplied as an
    argument of the `readepi()` function. Use the `show_example_file()`
    function to visualize the structure of the template credential file.

Users can read data from a RDBMS by providing the details of the tables
of interest or an SQL query (for more information, see the
**vignette**).

``` r
# DISPLAY THE STRUCTUTRE OF THE TEMPLATE CREDENTIAL FILE
show_example_file()

# DEFINE THE PATH TO THE CREDENTIAL FILE
credentials_file <- system.file("extdata", "test.ini", package = "readepi")

# READING FILE FROM A PROJECT IN A REDCap DATABASE
dat <- readepi(
  data_source      = "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/",
  credentials_file = credentials_file
)
project_data     <- dat$data # accessing the actual data
project_metadeta <- dat$metadata # accessing the metadata associated with project

# VIEWING THE LIST OF ALL TABLES IN A MySQL DATABASE
show_tables(
  data_source      = "mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk",
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  driver_name      = "" # note that this example MySQL server does not require a driver
)

# VISUAIZE FIRST 5 ROWS OF THE TABLE 'AUTHOR'
visualise_table(
  data_source      = "mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk",
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  from             = "author", # this is the table name
  driver_name      = ""
)

# READING ALL FILEDS AND RECORDS FROM A MySQL SERVER
dat <- readepi(
  data_source      = "mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk",
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  from             = "author", # this is the table name
  driver_name      = ""
)

# READING DATA FROM DHIS2
dat <- readepi(
  data_source        = "https://play.dhis2.org/dev",
  credentials_file   = credentials_file,
  dataset            = "pBOMPrpg1QX",
  organisation_unit  = "DiszpKrYNg8",
  data_element_group = NULL,
  start_date         = "2014",
  end_date           = "2023"
)

# READING DATA FROM THE FINGERTIPS REPOSITORY
dat <- readepi(
  indicator_id        = 90362,
  area_type_id        = 202,
  parent_area_type_id = 6 # optional
)
```

## Package Vignettes

The vignette of the **{readepi}** package contains detailed
illustrations about the use of each function and the description of
every argument. This can be accessed by typing the command below:

``` r
# OPEN THE VIGNETTE WITHIN RSTUDIO
vignette("readepi")

# OPEN THE VIGNETTE IN YOUR WEB BROWSER.
browseVignettes("readepi")
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *maturing*, as defined by the [RECON
software lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This
means that it can be used in production with the understanding that the
interface may still undergo minor changes.
