**{{ packagename }}** is an R package for reading data from several health information systems (HIS) including public repositories, relational database management systems (RDBMS).

**{{ packagename }}** currently supports reading data from the followings:

-   RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) such as MS SQL,  MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite\ 
-   [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/about/): an open source and web-based platform for managing health information\
-   [SORMAS](https://sormas.org/): a eHealth system for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and responding to outbreak situations

**{{ packagename }}** returns a data frame with the data from the specified system.

**{{ packagename }}** is developed by [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) team at the [Medical Research Center, The Gambia unit at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia).


## Installation

**{{ packagename }}** can be installed from CRAN using

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readepi")
```

The latest development version of **{{ packagename }}** from [GitHub](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/readepi) with:

```{r message=FALSE}
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
library(readepi)
```

## Quick start

**{{ packagename }}** currently has three main functions that read data from a specified source. While the arguments to these functions are generally similar, some are specific to their data source (see the **vignette** for more details). The examples below show how to use the package functionalities to import data from a variety of sources.

### Reading data from RDBMS

The `read_rdbms()` function is used to import data from a variety of RDBMS, including MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Reading data from a RDBMS requires:

* A MS SQL driver that is compatible with the version of DBMS of interest. The
[install drivers vignette](./vignettes/install_drivers.Rmd) vignette describes how to install the appropriate driver for each database management system.

Users can read data from a RDBMS by providing a list with the query parameters of interest or an SQL query (for more information, see the **vignette**). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# CONNECT TO THE TEST MYSQL SERVER
rdbms_login <- readepi::login(
  from = "mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk",
  type = "mysql",
  user_name = "rfamro",
  password = "",
  driver_name = "",
  db_name = "Rfam",
  port = 4497
)

# DISPLAY THE LIST OF TABLES FROM A DATABASE OF INTEREST
tables <- readepi::show_tables(login = rdbms_login)

# READING ALL FIELDS AND ALL RECORDS FROM ONE TABLE (`author`) USING AN SQL QUERY
dat <- readepi::read_rdbms(
  login = rdbms_login,
  query = "select * from author"
)

# SELECT FEW COLUMNS FROM ONE TABLE AND LEFT JOIN WITH ANOTHER TABLE
dat <- readepi::read_rdbms(
    login = rdbms_login,
    query = "select author.author_id, author.name,
  family_author.author_id from author left join family_author on
  author.author_id = family_author.author_id"
)

# READING ALL FIELDS AND ALL RECORDS FROM ONE TABLE (`author`) WHERE QUERY PARAMETERS ARE SPECIFIED AS A LIST
dat <- readepi::read_rdbms(
  login = rdbms_login,
  query = list(table = "author", fields = NULL, filter = NULL)
)
```

### Reading data from DHIS2

```{r eval=FALSE}
# CONNECT TO A DHIS2 INSTANCE
dhis2_login <- readepi::login(
  type = "dhis2",
  from = "https://smc.moh.gm/dhis",
  user_name = "test",
  password = "Gambia@123"
)

# IMPORT DATA FROM DHIS2 FOR THE SPECIFIED ORGANISATION UNIT AND PROGRAM IDs
data <- readepi::read_dhis2(
  login = dhis2_login,
  org_unit = "GcLhRNAFppR",
  program = "E5IUQuHg3Mg"
)
```

### Reading data from SORMAS

```{r eval=FALSE}
# CONNECT TO THE SORMAS SYSTEM
sormas_login <- readepi::login(
  type = "sormas",
  from = "https://demo.sormas.org/sormas-rest",
  user_name = "SurvSup",
  password = "Lk5R7JXeZSEc"
)

# FETCH ALL COVID (coronavirus) CASES FROM THE TEST SORMAS INSTANCE
covid_cases <- readepi::read_sormas(
  login = sormas_login,
  disease = "coronavirus",
)
```

## Package Vignettes

The vignette of the **{{ packagename }}** package contains detailed illustrations about the use of each function and the description of every argument. This can be accessed by typing the command below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# OPEN THE VIGNETTE WITHIN RSTUDIO
vignette("readepi")

# OPEN THE VIGNETTE IN YOUR WEB BROWSER.
browseVignettes("readepi")
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently *maturing*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that it can be used in production with the understanding that the interface may still undergo minor changes.
