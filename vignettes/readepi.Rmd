# Overview 
Health-related data in general, and epidemiological data in particular, are stored in files, relation database management systems (RDBMS), or health information systems (HIS). Each category includes numerous options, such as various file formats, RDBMS types, and HIS APIs. To import data from such repositories involve the usage of different format-specific functions or API-specific packages, which is an exhausting task for end users. 

The main objective of **readepi** package is to simplify the process of reading health-related data from diverse sources, allowing the user to focus more on downstream analysis tasks. **readepi**  also streamlines the way data is read into a single function ---it imports data from a specified repository (can be file, or  directory, or  SQL database, or HIS API) using the `readepi()` function, which returns a  list object containing one or more data frames.

**readepi** provides a function for reading data from three common HIS ([REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/), and [Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/)), RDBMS servers (MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL), and from files of almost any format. Other utility functions for processing and manipulating the imported data, such as row or column sub-setting, are also included in this package.


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  dpi = 300
)
```

```{r setup}
# LOAD readepi
library(readepi)
```

# Reading data from file or directory
The `readepi()` function can read data from a single file or from multiple files in a directory. This function expects the following arguments:  

1. `file_path`: a string specifying the path to the file or directory of interest.
2. `format`: a string used to specify the file format.
3. `sep`: (optional) a separator between the columns in the file.
4. `which`: (optional) a string specifying which objects to import, e.g., name(s) of sheet(s) in an Excel file.    
5. `pattern`: (optional) a string used to read only files in a given directory that contain this pattern.

**Note** that the argument `sep` is necessary only for space-separated files. This is useful for reading files in formats not supported by the [rio](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html#Data_Import) package. Several examples of how to use the `readepi()` function to import data from files of different formats are shown below.  

## Importing data from file
Many RDBMS can export data into `JSON` format that can be read into R using the `readepi()` function as in the below example.      
```{r eval=FALSE}
file <- system.file("extdata", "test.json", package = "readepi")
data <- readepi(file_path = file)
```

The `readepi()` function can also read data from a sheet(s) in an MS Excel file. If the file contains multiple sheets, the user must supply the names of the sheets of interest, as shown in the examples below.     
```{r eval=FALSE}
#READ DATA FROM SHEET2 IN THE TEST.XLSX FILE
file <- system.file("extdata", "test.xlsx", package = "readepi")
data <- readepi(file_path = file, which = "Sheet2")

# IMPORTING DATA FROM MULTIPLE SHEETS
file <- system.file("extdata", "test.xlsx", package = "readepi")
data <- readepi(file_path = file, which = c("Sheet2", "Sheet1"))
```

## Importing data from files in a directory
`readepi()` can read data from multiple files in the same directory. When the directory contains files of several formats, the `pattern` argument must be used to define the file type of interest. See the following examples.    
```{r eval=FALSE}
# READING ALL FILES IN A DIRECTORY
dir_path <- system.file("extdata", package = "readepi")
data <- readepi(file_path = dir_path)

# READING ONLY '.TXT' FILES IN THE GIVEN DIRECTORY
data <- readepi(file_path = dir_path, pattern = ".txt")

# READING ALL THE '.TXT' and '.XLSX' FILES IN THE GIVEN DIRECTORY i
data <- readepi(file_path = dir_path, pattern = c(".txt", ".xlsx"))
```

# Reading data from RDBMS 
Health related research data are usually stored in either relational databases or non-SQL databases.  For example, at [MRCG@LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia), projects data are stored in relational databases. A SQL-based database is run under a specific sever. The current version of the `readepi` package supports reading data from  MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL servers.

To read data from an MS SQL database the,  the user must have  access credentials as well as the appropriate  server driver installed into `R`, which is machine specific. In the following sections we show how  to install appropriate drivers and describe the structure of the credentials file.

## MS SQL drivers for Unix-based systems
To read data from Unix-based systems, it requires to install an MS ODBC driver that is compatible with the version of the target MS SQL server. Forexample, ***ODBC Driver 17***  is compatible with  ***SQL server 2019, version 15.0***.    

Mac users can follow the instructions below to install the MS SQL ODBC driver. Choose the appropriate driver, open the terminal, and run these instructions.    
 
1. installation of MS SQL driver 17  on Mac
```{bash eval=FALSE}
driver=17
brew install unixodbc
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew update
brew install msodbcsql${driver}
brew install mssql-tools
ODBCSYSINI=/
```

2. installation of MS SQL driver 13.1 on Mac
```{bash eval=FALSE}
brew install unixodbc
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew update
brew install msodbcsql@13.1.9.2
brew install mssql-tools@14.0.6.0
ODBCSYSINI=/
```

## MS SQL drivers for Linux-based systems
Note that this requires **Ubuntu 16.04 and above**. Choose the proper driver, open the terminal and type the instruction:  

1. installation of MS SQL driver version 17 on `Ubuntu`

```{bash eval=FALSE}
driver=17
sudo su
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
exit

sudo apt-get update
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y msodbcsql${driver}
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y mssql-tools
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install -y unixodbc-dev
```

2. installation of MS SQL driver version 13.1 on `Ubuntu`
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo su
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
exit
sudo apt-get update
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install mssql-tools
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```

3. installation of MS SQL driver on other Linux distributions \
To install driver MS SQL for other Linux distributions, such as Debian and Fedora, click [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ubuntu18-install%2Cubuntu17-install%2Cubuntu16-install%2Cubuntu16-13-install%2Crhel7-offline) and follow the instructions. After the  installation, check the installed drivers  using:       
```{r eval=FALSE}
odbc::odbcListDrivers()
```

If this command  does not return list of installed drivers or if you are facing issues during the driver installation process, consult [the odbc github page](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc#installation) or the [MS documentation on this topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos?view=sql-server-ver15). 

It is also important to view the data stored in the MS SQL server. For that purpose, we recommend you to install a graphical user interface (GUI) such as `Azure Data Studio`.
         
## Credentials file

The database management system requests user credentials, such as name and password, to access data stored on a server.  The **readepi** package allows you to save this information in a file with a certain structure and then pass its path as the value for the `credentials_file` parameter in the `readepi()` function.

The `readepi()` function accepts a tab-delimited  credential file with the following columns:

1. `user_name`: the user name.\  
2. `password`: the user password (in REDCap, this corresponds to  token).\
3. `host_name`: the host name  (in REDCap, this corresponds to the host URL).\    
4. `project_id`: the name of the database (for relation DB) or the name of project  (for REDCap API) that contains data of interest. \
5. `comment`: (optional) a brief description of the project or database of interest.\     
6. `dbms`: the type of the DBMS server. Use 'redcap' or 'REDCap' when reading from REDCap; 'sqlserver' or 'SQLServer' for MS SQL server.\    
7. `port`: (optional)  the port ID, this is only used for MS SQL servers.

To see the structure of a hypothetical credentials file used as a template in the `readepi` package, use the `show_example_file()` function, as shown below.
     
```{r eval=FALSE}
# DISPLAY THE STRUCTURE OF THE CREDENTIALS FILE
show_example_file()
```

In addition to credentials file, the `readepi()` function expects the following arguments:

- `driver_name`: (optional) the name of the MS driver (only for MS SQL servers).
- `source`: (optional) this can be a vector of  table names or an SQL query.
- `records`: (optional) a vector or a comma-separated string of a subset of subject IDs. When specified, only the records that correspond to these subjects will be imported.
- `fields`: (optional) a vector or a comma-separated string of column names. If provided, only those columns will be imported.
- `id_position`: (optional) the column position of the variable that unique identifies the subjects. It's default value is 1.
- `id_col_name`: (optional) the name of the column that unique identifies the subjects.



## Examples
This section contains various examples demonstrating how `readepi` imports data from databases. We assumed that the credentials are stored in  file as explained above. Furthermore, these examples are based on a MySQL server that does not need the user to supply the `driver name`.
  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# DEFINING THE CREDENTIALS FILE
credentials_file <- system.file("extdata", "test.ini", package = "readepi")
```

1. **Listing  names of all tables in a database**\
To display  list of tables from a database of interest, use:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
show_tables(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam", # this is the database name
  driver_name = "" # ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
)
# use driver_name = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server" when reading from MS SQL
# server
```



2.  **Fetching data using table names**\
```{r eval=FALSE}
# READING ALL FIELDS AND ALL RECORDS FROM ONE TABLE (`author`)
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "", # ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
  source = "author" # this is the database name
)

# VISUALIZING THE FIRST 5 ROWS OF THE TABLE 'author'
visualise_table(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  source = "author", # this is the table name
  project_id = "Rfam", # this is the database name
  driver_name = ""
)

# READING SPECIFIED FIELDS AND ALL RECORDS FROM ONE TABLE
fields <- "author_id,name,last_name,initials"
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "author",
  fields = fields # these are  the columns of interest.
)

# READING SPECIFIED RECORDS AND ALL FIELDS FROM ONE TABLE
records <- "1, 34, 15, 70, 118, 20"
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "author",
  records = records,
  id_position = 1
)

# READING SPECIFIED FIELDS AND RECORDS ONE THE TABLE
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "author",
  records = records,
  fields = fields,
  id_col_name = "author_id"
)

# READING DATA FROM SEVERAL TABLES
table_names <- c("author", "family_author")
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = table_names
)

# READING DATA FROM SEVERAL TABLES AND SUBSETTING FIELDS ACROSS TABLES
fields <- c(
  "author_id,name,last_name,initials",
  "rfam_acc,author_id"
)
# the first string in the field vector corresponds to the name of the
# columns of interest from the first table specified in the `table_names`
# argument and so on...
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = table_names,
  fields = fields
)

# READING DATA FROM SEVERAL TABLES AND SUBSETTING RECORDS ACROSS TABLES
records <- c(
  "1, 34, 15, 70, 118, 20",
  "RF00591,RF01420,RF01421"
)
# "note that first string in the records vector corresponds to the records of
# interest from the first table specified in the `table_name` argument and so
# on... when the id column is not the first column in a table,
# use the `id_position`"
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = table_names,
  records = records,
  id_position = c(1, 1)
)

# READING DATA FROM SEVERAL TABLES AND SUBSETTING RECORDS AND FIELDS ACROSS
# TABLES
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = table_names,
  records = records,
  fields = fields,
  id_col_name = c("author_id", "rfam_acc")
)
```

3. **Fetching data using an SQL query**
```{r eval=FALSE}
# SELECT FEW COLUMNS FROM ONE TABLE AND LEFT JOIN WITH ANOTHER TABLE
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "select author.author_id, author.name, family_author.author_id from 
  author left join family_author on author.author_id = family_author.author_id"
)

# SELECT ALL DATA FROM THE author TABLE
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "select * from author"
)

# SELECT FEW COLUMNS FROM THE author TABLE
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "select author_id, name, last_name from author"
)

# SELECT FEW RECORDS FROM THE author TABLE
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "select * from author where author_id in ('1','20','50')"
)

# SELECT FEW RECORDS AND FIELDS FROM THE author TABLE
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file,
  project_id = "Rfam",
  driver_name = "",
  source = "select author_id, name, last_name from author where 
  author_id in ('1','20','50')"
)
```

## Reading data from HIS
The current version of `readepi` package supports reading data from three common HIS: REDCap, DHIS2, and Fingertips. 

### Importing data from REDCap

Research Electronic Data Capture ([REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/)) is a web-based application and workflow methodology for designing clinical and translational research databases.
To import data from REDCap-based repo, the `readepi()`  function takes the following arguments:     

* `credentials_file`: the credentials file (mandatory)
* `project_id` the project ID (mandatory)
* `records`: the list of the desired records (optional)
* `fields`: the list of the desired columns (optional)

Both the data and its associated metadata will be will be returned after a successful import.    

```{r eval=FALSE}
# READING ALL FIELDS AND RECORDS FROM A REDCap PROJECT
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "SD_DATA"
)
project_data <- data$data
project_metadeta <- data$metadata

# READING SPECIFIC FIELDS AND ALL RECORDS FROM THE PROJECT
fields <- c("record_id", "name_first", "age", "bmi")
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "SD_DATA",
  fields = fields
)

# READING SPECIFIC RECORDS AND ALL FIELDS FROM THE PROJECT
records <- c("1", "3", "5")
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "SD_DATA",
  records = records,
  id_col_name = "record_id"
)

# READING SPECIFIC RECORDS AND FIELDS FROM THE PROJECT
data <- readepi(credentials_file,
  project_id = "SD_DATA",
  records = records,
  fields = fields,
  id_col_name = "record_id"
)
project_data <- data$data
project_metadeta <- data$metadata
```


## Importing data from DHIS2

[DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/about/) is open source software that has transformed global health information management. The `readepi()` function can import data from  DHIS2-based repositories with following arguments:

* `credentials_file`: the credentials file (required)
* `project_id`: the project ID (required)
* `dataset`: the dataset identifier (required)
* `organisation_unit`: the organisation unit identifier (required)    
* `data_element_group`: the data element group (optional)    
* `start_date`: the start date for the time span of the values to export (required)    
* `end_date`: the end date for the time span of the values to export (required)   
* `id_col_name`: the column name with the records of interest (optional)    
* `records`: the list of the desired records (optional)     
* `fields`: the list of the desired columns (optional)    

```{r eval=FALSE}
# GETTING THE DATA ELEMENT IDENTIFIERS AND NAMES
data_elements <- all_data_elements(
  base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/dev/",
  username = "admin",
  password = "district"
)

# GETTING THE DATASET IDENTIFIERS AND NAMES
datasets <- all_datasets(
  base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/dev/",
  username = "admin",
  password = "district"
)

# GETTING THE ORGANISATION UNIT IDENTIFIERS AND NAMES
organisation_units <- all_datasets(
  base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/dev/",
  username = "admin",
  password = "district"
)

# GETTING THE DATA ELEMENT GROUP IDENTIFIERS AND NAMES
data_element_groups <- all_organisation_units(
  base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/dev/",
  username = "admin",
  password = "district"
)

# READING THE DATASET ID `pBOMPrpg1QX`
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "DHIS2_DEMO",
  dataset = "pBOMPrpg1QX",
  organisation_unit = "DiszpKrYNg8",
  data_element_group = NULL,
  start_date = "2014",
  end_date = "2023"
)

# READING DATA FROM 2 DATASETS `pBOMPrpg1QX`
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "DHIS2_DEMO",
  dataset = "pBOMPrpg1QX,BfMAe6Itzgt",
  # same as dataset=c("pBOMPrpg1QX","BfMAe6Itzgt")
  organisation_unit = "DiszpKrYNg8",
  data_element_group = NULL,
  start_date = "2014",
  end_date = "2023"
)

# READING SPECIFIC DATA ELEMENTS FROM THE DATASET ID `pBOMPrpg1QX`
data_elts <- c("FTRrcoaog83", "eY5ehpbEsB7", "Ix2HsbDMLea")
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "DHIS2_DEMO",
  dataset = "pBOMPrpg1QX",
  organisation_unit = "DiszpKrYNg8",
  data_element_group = NULL,
  start_date = "2014",
  end_date = "2023",
  records = data_elts,
  id_col_name = "dataElement"
)

# READING SPECIFIC COLUMNS FROM A DATASET
data <- readepi(
  credentials_file = credentials_file,
  project_id = "DHIS2_DEMO",
  dataset = "pBOMPrpg1QX,BfMAe6Itzgt",
  organisation_unit = "DiszpKrYNg8",
  data_element_group = NULL,
  start_date = "2014",
  end_date = "2023",
  fields = c("dataElement", "period", "value")
)
test_data <- data$data
```

## Importing data from Fingertips
[Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) is a repository for public health data indicators in England, in which data is organised into themed profiles. The `readepi()` function  allows you to import data from Fingertips-based APIs using the following arguments:

* `indicator_id`: the indicator ID
* `indicator_name`: the indicator name
* `area_type_id`: the area type ID. This determines the geographic area for the imported data
* `parent_area_type_id`: the parent area type code of the specified area type ID
* `profile_id`: the profile ID
* `profile_name`: the profile name
* `domain_id`: the domain ID
* `domain_name`: the domain name
* `records`: the list of the desired records     
* `fields`: the list of the desired columns 
* `id_col_name`: the column name with the records of interest 
* `id_position`: the column position of the variable that unique identifies the subjects. default is 1. 

It is worth noting that, while reading such data, the `readepi()` function makes wrapper-calls to the major functions in [fingertipsR](https://docs.ropensci.org/fingertipsR/), a pre-existing package that only reads data from Fingertips databases.



### Examples

This section provides various examples demonstrating how **readepi** imports data from Fingertips-based APIs.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDICATOR PROFILES, DOMAIN, AREA TYPE, ...
metadata <- get_fingertips_metadata()
head(metadata$indicator_profile_domain)
# indicator_profile_domain contains the indicator, profile,
# and domain information.
head(metadata$indicator_ids_names)
# indicator_ids_names contains the list of indicators IDs together
# with their names.
head(metadata$area_type)
# area_type contains the list of all area types with their associated
# parent area types.

# IMPORTING DATA USING THE INDICATOR ID
data <- readepi(
  indicator_id = 90362,
  area_type_id = 202
)

# IMPORTING DATA USING THE INDICATOR NAME
data <- readepi(
  indicator_name = "Healthy life expectancy at birth",
  area_type_id = 202
)

# IMPORTING DATA USING THE DOMAIN NAME
data <- readepi(
  domain_name = "A. Overarching indicators",
  area_type_id = 202
)

data <- readepi(
  indicator_name = "Healthy life expectancy at birth",
  area_type_id = 202,
  domain_name = "A. Overarching indicators"
)

# IMPORTING DATA USING THE PROFILE ID
data <- readepi(
  profile_id = 19,
  area_type_id = 202
)

# IMPORTING DATA FROM SPECIFIC INDICATOR, DOMAIN, PROFILE, AREA TYPE
data <- readepi(
  indicator_id = 90362,
  indicator_name = "Healthy life expectancy at birth",
  area_type_id = 202, parent_area_type_id = 6,
  profile_id = 19,
  profile_name = "Public Health Outcomes Framework",
  domain_id = 1000049, domain_name = "A. Overarching indicators",
  fields = NULL, records = NULL,
  id_position = NULL, id_col_name = NULL
)

# IMPORTING DATA AND SUBSETTING SPECIFIC RECORDS AND FIELDS
data <- readepi(
  indicator_id = 90362,
  area_type_id = 202,
  fields = c("IndicatorID", "AreaCode", "Age", "Value"),
  records = c("E92000001", "E12000002", "E12000009"),
  id_col_name = "AreaCode"
)
```
